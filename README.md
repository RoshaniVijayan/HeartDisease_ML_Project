# HeartDisease_ML_Project

Predicting heart disease using machine learning is a common task in healthcare analytics. To build a heart disease prediction model, I have used these steps:
Data Collection: Used the databased from Kaggle
Data Preprocessing: Prepared and cleaned the data. This includes handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding).
Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to gain insights into the data's distribution and relationships. Visualization techniques helped understand the data better.

Feature Selection/Engineering: Select relevant features that could improve the model's performance. 
Split the Data: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.
Chosen many  Machine Learning Algorithm: 
Select a suitable machine learning algorithm for classification. Common choices include decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks such as : 
1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2. Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
3. Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
4. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
5. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
6. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
7. XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
8. Artificial Neural Network(Keras)

Model Training: Trained the chosen model on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluatex the model's performance using metrics like accuracy.
